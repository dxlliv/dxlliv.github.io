Flying has become my passion in recent years. I built my first drone in 2018, and although I could fly very little since I was stuck at the desktop in a place without large meadows, every session felt like a special occasion. Being in an open space, surrounded by nothing but the sky, gave me an incredible sense of freedom.

For years, I relied on a setup featuring FlySky FS-X6B receivers paired with a Turnigy Evolution radio transmitter. This combination was my introduction to the hobby and it allowed me to learn the basics of flight and build confidence in the air. However, over time, I began to feel the need to push boundaries.

My old setup, while familiar and dependable, started to show its limits — restricted range and noticeable latency. Technology that allowed long-range flight also had become a standard and ELRS, in addition to being cheap and not closed-source, seemed great.

When I finally made the change, it felt like a big step forward. The improvement in range and latency was undeniable, and I quickly appreciated how responsive and connected my quad felt. Every movement became sharper, more precise, and thrilling.

Switching to ELRS marked a new chapter in my flying journey. From then on, I started fitting all my drones with ELRS receivers for better range and reliable communication.
