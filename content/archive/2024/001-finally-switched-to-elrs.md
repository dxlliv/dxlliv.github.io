# The day I switched to ELRS

Flying has become my passion in recent years. I built my first drone in 2018, and while I didn’t fly often, every session felt like a special occasion. Being in an open space, surrounded by nothing but the sky, gave me an incredible sense of freedom and joy.

For years, I relied on a setup featuring FlySky FS-X6B receivers paired with a Turnigy Evolution radio transmitter. This combination was my introduction to the hobby and it allowed me to learn the basics of flight and build confidence in the air. However, over time, I began to feel the need to push boundaries. My old setup, while familiar and dependable, started to show its limits — restricted range and noticeable latency. Then I decided to switch to ELRS.

When I finally made the change, it felt like a big step forward. The improvement in range and latency was undeniable, and I quickly appreciated how responsive and connected my quad felt. Every movement became sharper, more precise, and thrilling.

Switching to ELRS marked a new chapter in my flying journey, but it’s only part of the story. Every piece of equipment I’ve used has played a role in shaping my experience and passion for drones.
