Flying has become my passion in recent years. I built my first drone in 2018, but I always found little time to go out flying since I was often stuck working or nerding at the desktop.

Unfortunately, I wasn't living in a place with large meadows or open spaces, which made flying even more challenging. Despite this, every session always felt like a special occasion. Being surrounded by nothing but the sky gave me an incredible sense of freedom.

For years, I relied on a setup featuring FlySky FS-X6B receivers paired with a Turnigy Evolution radio transmitter. I started with some cheap, pre-assembled Eachine drones and this combination introduced me to the hobby, allowing me to learn the basics of flight and build confidence in the air. However, over time, I began to feel the urge to push these limits.

My initial setup, while familiar and dependable, started to feel restrictive. As long-range flight technology became more common, ELRS emerged as an affordable, open-source solution that seemed like a perfect fit. The new receivers were also really compact.

I then chose the RadioMaster Pocket ELRS 2.4 GHz as my next radio transmitter, and it immediately felt like a huge step forward. The improvement in range and latency was really undeniable, and I quickly appreciated how responsive and connected my drone felt. Every movement became sharper, more precise, and thrilling.

Switching to ELRS marked a new chapter in my flying journey. From then on, I started fitting all my drones with ELRS receivers embracing better range and reliable communication.
